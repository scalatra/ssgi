/**
 * An HTTP response.  Based on the Rack specification and Python WSGI (PEP-333).
 *
 * @param status The HTTP status.  Must be greater than or equal to 100.
 *
 * @param headers The header must not contain a Status key, contain keys with : or newlines in their name, contain
 * key names that end in - or _, but only contain keys that consist of letters, digits, _ or - and start with a letter.
 * The values of the header must consist of lines (for multiple header values, e.g. multiple Set-Cookie values)
 * separated by "\n". The lines must not contain characters below 037.  There must be a Content-Type, except when the
 * Status is 1xx, 204 or 304, in which case there must be none given.  There must not be a Content-Length header when
 * the Status is 1xx, 204 or 304.
 *
 * @param body The response body.  Should be transformed to a Traversable[Byte] before returning to the web server.
